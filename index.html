        Turtle Facts
    </h1>

    <p>
        When the turtles come out at night, even the steeliest bogmen quake at the thought of their terrible claws and beaks. 
        Turtles are known for being nocturnal amush predators, primarily dwelling in the dense forest canopy, hanging from 
        branches suspended directly above their unwitting victims.
        Typically turtles prey on people with low self-esteem, 
        who place a high value on luxury goods. Turtles are known for being able to spot a fake Gucci or Prada bag from at least 50 meters.</p>
